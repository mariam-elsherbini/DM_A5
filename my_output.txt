=== WORKFLOW COMPARISON RESULTS ===

Overall Workflow Scores:
Pipeline Workflow: 0.72
Reflexion Workflow: 0.75
Agent Workflow: 0.70

Best Workflow: Reflexion (Score: 0.75)

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Pipeline Workflow:
  Strengths:
  - Simple and straightforward implementation
  - Predictable execution flow
  - Easy to debug and maintain
  Weaknesses:
  - Limited flexibility in task ordering
  - No ability to use results from multiple upstream tasks
  - No self-correction mechanism

Reflexion Workflow:
  Strengths:
  - Self-correction improves output quality
  - More flexible than pipeline workflow
  - Explicit evaluation criteria for each task
  Weaknesses:
  - More complex implementation
  - Potentially higher cost due to multiple LLM calls
  - May not always converge to better results

Agent Workflow:
  Strengths:
  - Most flexible approach
  - Can dynamically decide task order
  - Ability to handle complex dependencies
  Weaknesses:
  - Most complex implementation
  - Less predictable behavior
  - Potential for inefficient tool usage
